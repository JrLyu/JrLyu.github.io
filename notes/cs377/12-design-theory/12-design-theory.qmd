## Introduction
- It allows us to improve a schema **systematically**.
- General idea:
  - Express constraints on the relationship between attributes.
  - Use thse to decompose the relations.
- Ultimately, get a schema that is in a "normal form" that guarantees good properties, such as no anomalies.
- "Normal" in the sense of conforming to a standard. 

:::{#nte-normalization .callout-note}
## Normalization
The process of converting a schema to a normal form is called **normalization**.
:::

- End goal: Design a "good" normalized schema that reduces redundancy (thus reducing storage waste, anomalies) and ensures data integrity (BCNF Normalization).

## Functional Dependencies (FD)
- Poorly designed schemas can lead to **anomalies**.
  - In any domain, there are relationships between attribute values.
  - For example: 
    - Every part has 1 manufacturer
    - Every manufacturer has 1 address
    - Every seller has 1 address 
  - If so, this table will have redundant data.

| part | manufacturer | manAddress | seller | sellerAddress | price |
|:----:|:------------:|:----------:|:------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
| P1   | M1           | A1         | S1     | A2            | 100   |

- **Update anomaly**: If one manufacturer moves to a new address, we need to update all the rows with the same manufacturer. If we only update one row, the data will be inconsistent.
- **Deletion anomaly**: If one manufacturer stops selling a part, we delete the row. But we also lose the address information.

:::{#nte-fd .callout-note}
## Functional Dependencies
Suppose $R$ is a relation, and $X$ and $Y$ are subsets of the attributes of $R$. 
- Then, $X\to Y$, read as "$X$ funtionally determines $Y$", is called a **functional dependency**. 
- $X\to Y$ holds in $R$ $\iff$ two tuples agree on all the attributes in set $X$, they must also agree on all the attributes in set $Y$.

- Functional dependencies are constraints on the relation.
- Symbolically, $A\to B$ means
  - $\forall$ tuples $t_1, t_2$, $(t_1[A]=t_2[A])\implies(t_1[B]=t_2[B])$, or
  - $\neg\exists$ tuples $t_1, t_2$ such that $(t_1[A]=t_2[a])\land(t_1[B]\neq t_2[B])$.
- Functional dependencies can be extended to multiple attributes.
:::

- Why "functional dependency"?
  - "dependency" because the value of $Y$ depends on the value of $X$.
  - "functional" because there is a function that takes a value for $X$ and gives a unique value for $Y$.
  - *(It's not a typical function; just a lookup.)*

:::{#wrn-fd .callout-warning}
## Equivalent sets of FDs
- When we write a set of FDs, we mean that all of them hold.
- We can very often rewrite sets of FDs in equivalent ways.
- When we say $S1$ is equivalent to $S2$ we mean:
  - $S1$ holds in a relation $\iff$ $S2$ does.

## Example of FD
- Create an instance of $R$ that violates $BC\to D$:

| A | B | C | D |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |

- Is the FD $A\to BC$ equivalent to the two FDs $A\to B$ and $AÃ \to C$?
  - Yes, because if $A\to BC$ holds, then $A\to B$ and $A\to C$ must hold.
- Is the FD $AB\to C$ equivalent to the two FDs $A\to B$, $A\to C$ ?
  - No.

| A | B | C |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 1 | 3 | 5 |
:::

- Splitting rules of FD: 
  - Can we split (explode) the RHS of an FD and get multiple, equivalent FDs? 
    - Yes.
  - Can we split (explode) the LHS of an FD and get multiple, equivalent FDs? 
    - No.
- Coincidence or FD
  - An FD is an assertion about every instance of the relation.
  - You can't know it holds just by looking at one instance.
  - You must use knowledge of the domain to determine wheter an FD holds.

:::{#tip-fd-coincidence .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Coincidence or FD
Consider the following table

| Teacher | Course | Text |
|:-------:|:------:|:----:|
|  Smith  | CS170  | Martin |
|  Hall   | CS171  | Hoffman |
|   Brown | CS253  | Horowitz|

- Does $\text{Teacher}\to\text{Course}$ hold in this instance?
  - Yes.
- Should $\text{Teacher}\to\text{Course}$ hold?
  - No, because one teacher can teach multiple courses.
- Does $\text{Course}\to\text{Text}$ hold in this instance?
  - Yes.
- Should $\text{Course}\to\text{Text}$ hold?
  - No, because one course can have multiple textbooks. For example, different professors may use different textbooks for the same course.
  - It may hold in some cases, where the department has a policy that all sections of a course use the same textbook.
:::

- FDs are closely related to **keys**
  - Recall: A **superkey** is a set of attributes for which no two rows can have the same values
  - Suppose $K$ is a set of attributes for relation $R$.
  - A claim about FDs:
    - $K$ is a superkey for $R\iff K$ functionally determines *all of $R$*.

:::{#nte-superkey .callout-note}
## FDs are a Generalization of Keys

- ***Superkey***: $X\to R(\text{All Attributes})$
- ***Functional Dependency***: $X\to Y$
- A superkey must include *all* the attributes of the relation on the RHS
- An FD can have just a *subset* of them.
:::

- Inferring FDs:
  - Given a set of FDs, one can infer further FDs.
  - Big task: given a set of FDs, infer every other FD that must also hold.
  - Simpler task: given a set of FDs, infer whether a given FD must also hold.

:::{#tip-fd-inference .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Inferring FDs
- If $A\to B$ and $B\to C$, can we infer $A\to C$?
  - Yes.
  - *Another way of asking: Does the FD $A\to C$ **follow from** $A\to B$ and $B\to C$?*
- If $A\to H$, $C\to F$, and $FG\to AD$ hold. 
  - Can we infer $FA\to D$?
  - Can we infer $CG\to FH$?
  - These two questions are hard to answer, so we need a systematic way to infer FDs.
:::

- Prove an FD follows:
  - Method 1: First principles approach: You can prove it by referring back to
    - The FDs that you know hold, and 
    - Apply FD interence ruls (axioms)
  - Method 2 (easier): Closure Test

## Closure Test

:::{#nte-closure-test .callout-note}
## Closure Test to Infer FDs
- Assume you know the values of the LHS attributes, and figure out: everything else that can be determined.
- If the result includes the RHS attributes, then you know that the FD holds.
:::

:::{#nte-closure .callout-note}
## Closure of an Attribute
For a given arribute $Y$, the ***closure*** $Y^+$ is the set of all attributes such that $Y\to A$ can be inferred. 
:::

:::{#imp-closure-test .callout-important}
## Closure Algorithm
- $Y$ is a set of attributes, $S$ is a set of FDs.
- Return: the closure of $Y$ under $S$.
```
Attribute_closure(Y, S):
  Initialize Y+ to Y
  Repeat until no more changes occur:
    If there is an FD LHS -> RHS in S such that LHS is in Y+:
      Add RHS to Y+

  Return Y+
```

- If LHS is in $Y^+$ and LHS $\to$ RHS holds, we can add RHS to $Y^+$.
:::

:::{#imp-closure-test .callout-important}
## Closure Test Algorithm
- $S$ is a set of FDs, LHS $\to$ RHS is a single FD.
- Return: true $\iff$ LHS $\to$ RHS follows from $S$.

```
FD_follows(S, LHS -> RHS):
  Y+ = Attribute_closure(LHS, S)
  Return (RHS is in Y+)
```
:::

:::{#tip-closure-test .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Closure Test Example
- Suppose we have a relation on attributes $A, B, C, D, E, F$, with FDs:
  - $AC\to F$
  - $CEF\to B$
  - $C\to D$
  - $DC\to A$
- Does $C\to F$?
  - Compute $C^+$ under these FDs: $C^+=CDAF$
  - Then, $C\to F$ follows.
- Does $ACD\to B$?
  - Compute $(ACD)^+$ under these FDs: $(ACD)^+=ACDF$
  - Then, $ACD\to B$ does not follow.
:::

## FD Projection
- Motivation:
  - Later, we will learn how to **normalize** a schema by **decomposing** relations (this is the whole point of this theory).
  - We will need to be aware of what FDs hold in the new, smaller, relations.
  - In other words, we must **project our FDs** onto the attributes of our new (smaller) relations. 

:::{#tip-fd-projection .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## FD Projection
- Suppose we have a relation on attributes $ABCDE$ with FDs: $A\to C$, $C\to E$, $E\to BD$
- We want to project FDs onto attributes $ABC$
- To project onto a set of attributes, we systematically consider every possible LHS of an FD that might hold on those attributes. 
- $A^+={\color{red}AC}E{\color{red}B}D$. However, we only care about the smaller table we are projecting onto, so we only keep the attributes in the projection.
  - $A\to BC$.
- $B^+=B$
- $C^+={\color{red}C}E{\color{red}B}D$
  - $C\to B$
- $AB^+$ and $AC^+$
  - We don't need to consider any supersets of $A$. $A$ already determines all of the attributes in the projection $ABC$. So, supersets of $A$ will only yield FDs that are already implied by $A\to BC$.
  - Strength/Power of FDs: $X\to Y$ is a stronger FD than $XZ\to Y$.
- $BC^+=BCED$
- The **projection** of the FDs onto $ABC$ is $\{A\to BC,\ C\to B\}$
:::

## Database Normalization (BCNF)
:::{#nte-decomposition .callout-note}
## Decomposition

To improve a badly-designed schema $R(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n)$, we will decompose it into smaller relations $A(B_1,B_2,\dots,B_m)$ and $T(C_1,C_2,\dots,C_k)$ such that 

- $S={\Large{\pi}}_{B_1,B_2,\dots, B_m}(R)$,
- $T={\Large{\pi}}_{C_1,C_2,\dots,C_k}(R)$, and
- $\{A_1,A_2,\dots,A_n\}=\{B_1,B_2,\dots,B_m\}\cup\{C_1,C_2,\dots,C_k\}$
:::

- But which decomposition to use?
  - Decomposition can improve a schema, but which decomposition? *There are many possible decompositions.*
  - A "normal form" helps us characterize a decomposition, in terms of satisfied properties.
    - **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)** guarantees no anomalies.

### BCNF Test

:::{#nte-BCNF .callout-note}
## Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

We say a relation $R$ is in ***BCNF*** if: for every nontrivial FD $X\to Y$ that holds in $R$, $X$ is a superkey.

- Recall: nontrivial means $Y$ is not contained in $X$
- Recall: a super key does not have to be minimal.
- In order words, BCNF requries that "**Only things that FD everything, can FD anything.**"
- FDs with LHS that is not a superkey make the relation prone to *redundacy, anomalies*. 
:::

:::{#tip-BCNF-test .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example of BCNF Test

- Suppose we have a relation $\text{Students}(\text{SID}, \text{email}, \text{course}, \text{term}, \text{prof}, \text{grade})$ and that these FDs hold:
  - $\{\text{SID}\to\text{email}; \text{course},\text{term}\to\text{prof};\text{SID},\text{course}\to\text{grade}\}$
- Is this relation in BCNF?
- **Approach**: Test if the LHS in each FD is a superkey.
  - $\text{SID}^+=\text{SID}, \text{email}$
  - LHS is not a superkey, then $R$ is not in BCNF. We don't need to check other FDs. 
:::

### BCNF Decomposition
:::{#imp-BCNF-decomp .callout-important}
## BCNF Decomposition Algorithm
- $R$ is a relation; $F$ is a set of FDs
- Return: a BCNF decomposition of $R$, given these FDs.
```
BCNF_decomp(R, F):
  If an FD X -> Y in F violates BCNF
    1. Compute X+
    2. Replace R by two relations with shcemas:
      R_1 = X+
      R_2 = (R - X+) + X
      // X is the common between R_1 and R_2
    3. Project the FD's F onto R_1 and R_2
    4. Recursively apply BCNF_decomp to R_1 and R_2
```
:::

- If more than one FD violates BCNF, you may decompose based on any one of them.
  - Because of this, there may be multiple possible results.
- The new relations we create in one step may not be in BCNF. We must recurse.
  - We only keep the relations at the "leaves."

:::{#tip-BCNF-decomp .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example of BCNF Decomposition
Suppose we have the following FDs for $R(A, B, C, D, E)$:
$$
A\to B, CD\to E
$$

Apply BCNF Decomposition:

- Iteration 1: $R$
  - Consider $A\to B$: $A^+=AB$, and $A$ is not a superkey (violates BCNF).
  - Decompose: $R_1=AB$, $R_2=ACDE$
  - Project FDs: $R_1(A,B)$: 
    - $A\to B$ ($A$ is a super key)
    - $R_2(A, C, D, E): CD\to E$ ($CD$ is not a superkey).
- Iteration 2: Decompose $R_2$
  - Consider $R_2(A, C, D, E)$: $CD^+=CDE$, and $CD\to E$, $CD$ is not a superkey
  - Decompose: $R_3=CDE$, $R_4=ACD$
  - Project FDs:
    - $R_3(C, D, E)$: $CD\to E$ ($CD$ is a superkey)
    - $R_4(A, C, D)$: No FDs. Key: $ACD$
- BCNF Decomposition Result: $R_1(A, B)$, $R_3(C, D, E)$, $R_4\qty(A, C, D)$
:::

- Speed-ups for BCNF decomposition
  - Don't need to know all superkeys.
    - Only need to check whether the LHS of each FD is a superkey.
    - Use the closure test (simple and fast)
  - When projecting FDs onto a new relation, check each new FD:
    - Does the new relation violate BCNF because of this FD?
    - If os, abort the projection. You are about the discard this relation anyway (and domcpose further).

### Properties of Decomposition
- What we want from a decomposition (in general, not BCNF specifically)
  - No anomalies
  - Lossless Join: it should be possible to
    - project the original relations onto the decomposed schema
    - then reconstruct the original by joining. We should get back **exactly the original tuples**.
  - Dependency Preservation:
    - All the original FD's should be satisfied. 
- What is lost in a "lossy" join?
  - For any decomposition, it is the case that:
    - $r\subseteq r_1\bowtie\cdots\bowtie r_n$
    - i.e., we will get back every tuple.
  - But it may not be the case that:
    - $r\supseteq r_1\bowtie\cdots\bowtie r_n$
    - i.e., we can get spurious tuples. 

### Properties of BCNF decomposition, specifically
- BCNF ensures no anomalies.
- BCNF ensures lossless join.
- However, the BCNF property does not guarantee lossless join.
  - If you use the BCNF decomposition algorithm, then yes, a lossless join is guaranteed.
  - If you generate a decomposition some other way
    - You have to check to make sure you have a lossless join.
    - Even if your schema is in BCNF! 
- BCNF does not ensure dependency preservation.
- BCNF does not ensure that the decomposition is a "good" one.
  - BCNF decomposition deos not guarantee preservation of dependencies.
  - i.e., in the decomposed schema that results, it may be possible to create an instance that:
    - satisfies all the projected FDs in the final schema,
    - but violates one of the original FDs.
  - Why? Because the algorithm goes too far, and it breaks relations down too much. 

:::{#tip-BCNF-decomp-properties .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example of BCNF not Preserving Original FDs

Consider $\underline{C}SJDPQV$, $C$ is a key, $JP\to C$ and $SD\to P$.

- BCNF decomposition: $\underline{C}SJDQV$ and $\underline{SD}P$.
- Problem: Checking $JP\to C$ requires a joint (and there is no theoretical guarantee it will hold...)
:::

:::{#wrn-trade-off .callout-warning}
## Is there a decomposition that satisfies all $3$ properties?
- No! There is always a tradeoff.
- For example, another popular standard, "3NF" satisfies properties 2 and 3 only.
