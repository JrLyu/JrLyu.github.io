# Statement of Purpose
This is my test-blog to show case how to generate a blog post in Quarto.

## Some random thoughts
It is important to note that the front matter of the blog post is different from the front matter of the index page, notes page, and blogs page. The front matter of the blog post is used to provide metadata about the blog post, such as the title, description, author, date, categories, image, and draft status. The content of the blog post is written in markdown and can include text, images, links, and other markdown elements.
